Initial test version of THE ILNS project.


Our applications can be viewed as four major blocks of processing: 
positioning, navigation, database, and interface. 
Each block is responsible to different functionality of the application. 
- Positioning block is responsible for finding the current location of the user by 
combining WiFi positioning and inertial navigation system. 
- Navigation block is responsible for performing routing algorithm to find the shortest route 
between two positions and map matching algorithm to correlate the position on the map for graphical representation. 
- Database block is responsible for searching information of people and building. 
- Interface block is responsible for the graphical representation of the information and interaction with user
